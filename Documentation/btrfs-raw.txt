btrfs-raw(8)
============

NAME
----
btrfs-raw - low-level manipulation of btrfs meta data blocks.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*btrfs-raw* [[-r|-w] <bytenr>] <device>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*btrfs-raw* is used to dump the raw contents of the given logical block
of a btrfs device to stdout, or write raw data read from stdin to the
given logical block.

*THIS TOOL IS DANGEROUS; IT MAY CORRUPT YOUR FILESYSTEM BEYOND REPAIR!!*

Please exert extreme caution when writing modified blocks to disk. You
should make a backup copy of the entire file system before doing so, even
if the file system is already corrupted. Make sure you have a thorough
understanding of the btrfs disk data structures before making any changes.

*YOU USE THIS TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK!*

OPTIONS
-------
-r <bytenr>::
Read the logical block starting at <bytenr> and write the raw contents
to stdout (caution, binary data).
-w <bytenr>::
Write the logical block starting at <bytenr> to disk, reading data from
stdin. The tool will adjust the header checksum before writing to disk.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*btrfs-raw* will return 0 if no error happened.
If any problems happened, 1 will be returned.

EXAMPLE
-------

`btrfs-raw -r 874991616 /dev/sda >/tmp/blob`

`btrfs-raw -w 874991616 /dev/sda </tmp/blob`

Dump the data of the given block to a file and write it back.
Between these operations, a hex editor could be used to manually fix
inconsistencies in the meta data.
